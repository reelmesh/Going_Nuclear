# Going Nuclear CRUSH File

This file provides standardized commands and guidelines for developing the Going Nuclear Godot project.

---

### **Commands**

- **Run Project**: `godot`
- **Export (Linux)**: `godot --export-release "Linux/X11"`
- **Export (Windows)**: `godot --export-release "Windows Desktop"`
- **Export (macOS)**: `godot --export-release "macOS"`

*Note: Add export presets in the Godot editor under `Project > Export` for these commands to work.*

---

### **Code Style**

- **Naming**: Use `snake_case` for variables and functions (e.g., `current_player_index`). Use `PascalCase` for classes and scripts (e.g., `GameManager`).
- **Types**: Use static typing wherever possible (e.g., `variable: Type`). For example: `var active_players: Array[PlayerState] = []`.
- **Getters**: Access nodes with `@onready var node_name = $Path/To/Node`.
- **Scene Loading**: Preload scenes with `const SceneName = preload("res://path/to/scene.tscn")`.
- **Singletons**: Access autoloaded singletons directly by their names (e.g., `GameManager`, `Logger`, `EventBus`).
- **Logging**: Use the `Logger` singleton for all console output (`Logger.log("message")`). This allows for centralized log management.
- **Events**: Use the `EventBus` singleton for custom signals to decouple different parts of the game. For example: `EventBus.deployment_choice_made.emit(choice_data)`.
- **Error Handling**: Check for `null` instances before use, especially when dealing with nodes or resources. For example: `if my_node: my_node.do_something()`.

---

### **Best Practices**

- **Modularity**: Keep scenes and scripts small and focused on a single responsibility.
- **Readability**: Write clear code. Add comments for complex logic, explaining the *why* not the *what*.
- **Testing**: No formal testing framework is currently in place. Manual testing is required for all changes.

### **AI Context**

- **`ai_context_export.json`**: This file contains a JSON representation of the entire project structure, including scenes, scripts, and project settings. It is generated by the "AI Context Generator" plugin in the Godot editor and is used to provide context to AI assistants. To regenerate this file, open the Godot editor and run the "AI Context Generator" from the plugins menu.

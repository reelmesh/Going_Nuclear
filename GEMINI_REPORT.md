# Gemini Analysis Report: Going Nuclear

I have analyzed the GDScript files in your project. Here is a report of my findings and how I can help you.

### Project Overview

Your project, "Going Nuclear," appears to be a turn-based strategy game where players, representing different factions, attack each other using various types of cards. The game has a clear structure with managers for game state, cards, factions, and player feedback.

### File-by-File Analysis

Here's a breakdown of the scripts and their roles:

*   **`3d/`**:
    *   `InteractionController.gd`: Manages 3D object interaction, specifically detecting clicks on objects in the 3D world.
    *   `PhysicalButton3D.gd`: Implements a 3D button that can be pressed, triggering an animation and emitting a signal.

*   **`ai/`**:
    *   `AIController.gd`: Contains the logic for the AI's turn. The AI can choose a target based on different strategies (e.g., targeting the weakest or most-hated player) and execute attacks.

*   **`data/`**:
    *   `card_data.gd`: Defines the data structure for cards using a `Resource`. It uses a clever preset system to easily create different types of cards in the editor.
    *   `faction_data.gd`: Similar to `card_data.gd`, this script defines the data for each faction as a `Resource`, also with a preset system.
    *   `PlayerState.gd`: A `RefCounted` class that holds the state of a player during a match, including their faction, resources, and hand of cards.

*   **`managers/`**:
    *   `CardDatabase.gd`: Loads all `CardData` resources from a directory, creating a central database of all available cards.
    *   `EventBus.gd`: A global event bus for communication between different parts of the game.
    *   `FactionDatabase.gd`: Loads all `FactionData` resources, creating a database of all factions.
    *   `FeedbackManager.gd`: Manages visual feedback, such as displaying floating damage text.
    *   `GameManager.gd`: The core of the game's logic. It manages the game state, turns, player actions, and the main game loop.
    *   `Logger.gd`: A simple logger to display messages in a `RichTextLabel` and the console.
    *   `WinConditionManager.gd`: Checks for win/loss conditions.

*   **`ui/`**:
    *   `AvatarScreen2D.gd`: A UI component to display a faction's avatar.

### How I Can Help

Based on my analysis, here are some areas where I can assist you:

*   **Code Generation and Refactoring**: I can help you write new scripts, add new features to existing scripts, or refactor your code to improve its structure and readability. For example, I can help you:
    *   Implement new card types and their effects.
    *   Add more complex AI behaviors.
    *   Create new UI elements and their logic.
*   **Debugging**: If you encounter bugs, I can help you analyze your code and find the root cause of the problem. I can also help you write debugging tools and visualizations.
*   **Game Design and Balancing**: I can help you brainstorm new game mechanics, balance your existing systems, and create a more engaging player experience.
*   **Godot Engine Expertise**: I have a good understanding of the Godot Engine API and best practices. I can help you with any questions you have about the engine and its features.

### Next Steps

To get started, you can ask me to do any of the following:

*   "Create a new card that does..."
*   "Refactor the `AIController` to be more aggressive."
*   "I'm getting an error in the `GameManager`. Can you help me fix it?"
*   "How can I add a new UI screen to the game?"
